# DeckBuilder
 TCG deck builder

Scope:
```
I am intending for this to be a comprehensive trading 
card game deck builder. At the moment I plan to include 
- PokemonTCG 
- Magic: The Gathering
- Yu-Gi-Oh. 
```

Plan:
```
I will first start by trying to implement a deck builder 
for PokemonTCG. other deck builders will come later.

I'd like to implement a pricing feature, where users can 
price out the cost of their deck.

I intend to have a database setup for users to register, 
login and save decks they have built. Potentially including 
a card collection, where a user can add the cards they own.

I may attempt to implement a feature where the deck pricer 
will take into account which cards are already in the users 
collection; most likey set with a toggle if the user would 
like to price the total cost.
